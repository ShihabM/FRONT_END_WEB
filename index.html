        This about section also serves as the readme for the site. From the module perspective, the site was created using all three required languages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), which is predominantly hand-written code and responsive. The menu bar is displayed with a hamburger icon for mobile devices, and the other areas appropriately resize and wrap around in accordance with the screen size. The site maakes use of Twitter's API for the social area which displays a couple of tweets. Advanced CSS3 and JavaScript is used for mainly for the header section, where rotating shapes at different speeds give the wave-like effect, and is also employed for the parallax effect with the mountains.
        <br><br>
        The site is structured as a single-page site, with easy to navigate content that is simple enough to locate. It also makes use of flexbox for the footer area. The portfolio section is divided into sub-categories which are displayed as a dropdown menu on the menu bar. This site is accessible.</p>
